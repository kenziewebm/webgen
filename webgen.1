.Sh CLOSING TAGS
.Pp
Most tags here do not require a closing tag because you'll write usually next to them
.Pp
This, however, isn't true for \fB.noparse\fR, \fB.code\fR and \fB.quote\fR tags.
In order to close them, use \fB.end\fR, \fB.end\fR and \fB.endquote\fR respectively
.Pp
This was because Kenziewebm was too stupid to figure out another way
.
